## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With this analytics project, I want to study the winners and losers of each game and see if there is any correlation between the result and statistics such as shots, hits, and powerplays. This dataset is interesting to me because hockey is my favourite sport to watch. I am a die-hard Canucks fan and watch almost every game. I also tend to look at most stats after games are completed, so this dataset really appealed to me. The questions I want to explore as mentioned before was the link between the result and statistics. I am also curious about average shots, hits, power play goals for winning teams vs losing teams. I speculate that a higher shot count and power play goals will correlate with winning teams. I also speculate that home teams will posses more of the puck through higher faceoff percentages. I can imagine myself building a dashboard using this dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was provided by an individual named Martin Ellis. The inspiration to make the dataset was to look at advanced statistics to try to predict winners more accurately, as hockey has been known to be an unpredictable sport. Included in the dataset is statistics from **NHL games** such as goals, shots, hits, penalty minutes, powerplays, giveaways, and takeaways. Every game has two entries in the dataset; one for each team participating in the game. The whole document contains datasets as detailed as individual shifts and plays, but I decided to select the broader statistics from whole games. This data was taken over a span of 6 years, from *2013-2018*. The purpose of the dataset is to increase enjoyment of the game by statistical analysis. It is also aimed towards fans of the game like myself, just for fun. The data was pulled from NHL.com and another document from a man named Kevin Sidwar. The data was collected from humans.
